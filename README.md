# GoogleStockPricePrediction
This project is done as a part of the Deeplearning course by udemy. Recurrent neural networks(RNN) is used in order to predict the basic trent of Google stock prices baswed on the past three years of stock price using timestamps. RNN and LSTM(long short term memory) is used in order to create this predictor. The dataset was already provided in the course. 60 Timesteps were taken for the purpose ofprediction in this project.
